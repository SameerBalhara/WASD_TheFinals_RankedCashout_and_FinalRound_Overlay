# WASD_TheFinals_RankedCashout_and_FinalRound_Overlay
Applying scoreboard math to solve for who is alive and dead in The Finals Ranked Cashout and Final Round gamemodes (by default, this information is otherwise hidden)

**Instructions**
1. Press the green "Code" button in the top right and select "Download ZIP"
2. Unzip the file and only keep the following files: "WASD_RankedCashout_and_FinalRound_Overlay.exe", "settings.json", "README.md"
3. Customize settings.json with any preferred keybinds and save this file prior to launching the exe. Ensure settings.json and WASD_RankedCashout_and_FinalRound_Overlay.exe always exist in the same folder/directory

**Checklist**
1. Ensure Borderless Fullscreen Mode is enabled in-game
2. Customize your settings.json file with your preferred keybinds (replace the keybinds in the quotes, so if you changed f8 to f7, it will be "f7")
3. Add your initial screenshot key as a keybind in-game for scoreboard. Double check your scoreboard button has two keybinds associated afterwards
4. Disable any overlays placed in the top left of your screen (where the team colors and wipe information appear in-game)
5. Disable external crosshairs if they block any text on screen (otherwise fine)
6. Keep contracts ON
7. Disable any colorblind modes. Default team colors (orange, pink, purple) must be used
8. Play on either 3840 x 2160 (4K), 2560 x 1440 (1440p), or 1920 x 1080 (1080p). Aspect ratio must be 16:9. Stretched-res and other resolutions are not supported
9. Must use keyboard-mouse input
